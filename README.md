# Authentication-Secrets

To inspect the code for the module, you can clone this repository and use git checkout to see the completed code for each lesson. If you don't remember how to do this, be sure to revisit the Git and GitHub module in the course.

## My notes

This is part of Angela Yu's Udemy Complete Web Development Bootcamp course. 

The app is missing the .env file which contains the secret key for the app.

I will review this at some point but will archive the repo for now.
